# Four-axis-mechanical-arm
nverse kinematic trajectory planning for the secondary development of robotic arms based on open-source projects基于开源项目的机械臂的二次开发 逆运动学 轨迹规划
这是基于YouTube博主Build Some Stuff开源的四轴机械臂的二次开发。以此为载体实现了逆运动学和轨迹规划。该项目的3D文件和硬件组装选型购买可以移步到YouTube博主那里查看。上位机是python文件，下位机是arduino文件。仿真是matlab文件，要提前下载机器人工具箱。其中逆运动学和轨迹规划的核心算法是数值迭代法，区别于一般的解析法和几何法。上位机轨迹规划final对应的是下位机guijiguihua 上位机逆运动学对应的是下位机niyundongxue.感谢观看

This is a secondary development based on the open-sourced four-axis robotic arm by YouTube blogger Build Some Stuff. Based on this as the carrier, inverse kinematics and trajectory planning were realized. The 3D files of this project and the selection and purchase of hardware assembly can be viewed on the YouTube blogger. The upper computer is a python file, and the lower computer is an arduino file. The simulation is a matlab file. You need to download the robot toolbox in advance. Among them, the core algorithm of inverse kinematics and trajectory planning is the numerical iterative method, which is different from the general analytical method and geometric method. The upper computer trajectory 轨迹规划final to the lower computer guijiguihua, and the upper computer 逆运动学 corresponds to the lower computer niyundongxue. Thank you for watching.
